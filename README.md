# CNX-web3-demo
Code used for the 2023 CNX Web3 Demo plus extras

Front End Code:

This is the CloudPage in my Demo broken up into sections as they are in the CloudPage (HTML + Content Blocks)

Back End Code:

Place in a JSON Code Resource.


Extras not used in Demo:

moralis-api-blockchain-query.json is SSJS in a JSON code resource. We use a JSON code resource in Marketing Cloud for this becaues the results are returned in JSON format. A JSON code resource can process SSJS. This code resource was depreciated due to being able to leverage Salesforce Web3. However, the method in this code resource can be used to additional queries that might not be available in Salesforce, or querying other blockchains, as Salesforce Web3 currently only supports Ethereum and Polygon. See https://moralis.io/ for full API documentation and to create your own API key.
